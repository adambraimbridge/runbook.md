# Automated Import of RUNBOOK.MD files

This utility offers the user the opportunity to create and upload a RUNBOOK.MD file into Biz Ops to populate all the critical fields.

In this **BETA** implementation we offer both a GUI and a /ingest endpoint (to which you can POST RUNBOOK.MD) content

A sample of the format/content of the RUNBOOK.MD file can be seen [here](./EXAMPLE.MD)
